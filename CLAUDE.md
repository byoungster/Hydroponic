# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a public documentation repository for hydroponic gardening systems. It serves as a centralized location for guides, instructions, configuration files, and resources that can be easily shared via links.

## Repository Structure

```

├── guides/           # Comprehensive guides and tutorials
├── configs/          # Configuration files and templates
├── instructions/     # Step-by-step instructions for specific tasks
└── resources/        # Additional references and supplementary materials
```

## Content Guidelines

### Guides
- Should be comprehensive tutorials covering end-to-end processes
- Include overview, objectives, materials, steps, troubleshooting, and expected outcomes
- Use clear headings and structured formatting for easy navigation

### Configurations
- System parameters (pH, EC, temperature ranges)
- Nutrient and lighting schedules
- Automation and sensor settings
- Should be well-commented and ready to use or adapt

### Instructions
- Task-specific, detailed step-by-step procedures
- Include prerequisites, required tools, safety considerations, and verification steps
- Should be atomic and focused on a single task

### Resources
- Reference charts, tables, and external links
- Equipment lists and supplier information
- Research materials and supplementary reading

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word files (e.g., `nutrient-solution-mixing.md`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- For configurations, include the system type or purpose (e.g., `nft-system-config.yaml`)

## Formatting Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Use YAML or JSON for configuration files
- Include clear headings and table of contents for longer documents
- Add links between related documents when relevant
